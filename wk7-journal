"We are literally atop
untold histories: things, ideas, lives, and
activities that we have never seen before,
that we may know nothing of, and that
can thus endlessly surprise and transform
us. The very nature of archaeology, as a
subject open to interpretation when new
techniques, voices, and intellectual frameworks are introduced, furthers this facility
for surprise and transformation" Perry S. The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record. European Journal of Archaeology. 2019;22(3):355. doi:10.1017/eaa.2019.24 link

I feel like this is the main reason why many, if not most, people go into archaeology. Archaeology is a way to tell stories which have never been heard of before, or to corroborate history with actual evidence that these stories did occur, or didn't.
