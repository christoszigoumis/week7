"We are literally atop
untold histories: things, ideas, lives, and
activities that we have never seen before,
that we may know nothing of, and that
can thus endlessly surprise and transform
us. The very nature of archaeology, as a
subject open to interpretation when new
techniques, voices, and intellectual frameworks are introduced, furthers this facility
for surprise and transformation" Perry S. The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record. European Journal of Archaeology. 2019;22(3):355. doi:10.1017/eaa.2019.24 link

I feel like this is the main reason why many, if not most, people go into archaeology. Archaeology is a way to tell stories which have never been heard of before, or to corroborate history with actual evidence that these stories did occur, or didn't.

"Evidence indicates that our extant professional narratives
have not proven broadly successful at persuading people of the social benefits of
heritage (Nixon, 2017), and archaeologists
(perhaps the majority) lack the capacity
and support to create new narratives
(Wills, 2018: 33)." Perry S. The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record. European Journal of Archaeology. 2019;22(3):356. doi:10.1017/eaa.2019.24 link

This may be part of the reason why so much of the public believes pseudo-archaeological myths such as Atlantis and an Antarctic civilization, for instance.

"In other words,
the evidence that archaeology and heritage
institutions are genuinely realizing their
social value and civic welfare aims is questionable, if not non-existent." Perry S. The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record. European Journal of Archaeology. 2019;22(3):358. doi:10.1017/eaa.2019.24 link

I think this is especially true in countries which are either poor and people cannot be bothered to care about archaeology and museums when they're struggling to make enough money, and for countries whose museums do not have a strong tie to the material culture they are displaying, like many American or Canadian museums displaying Greek and Roman artefacts. Most people could not be bothered to learn of the importance of these artefacts.
